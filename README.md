# MALWARE
# Extract and Scan Disk Image Files

This Python script extracts files from a disk image, computes their SHA-256 hashes, and checks these hashes against the VirusTotal database to generate a security report.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Binwalk

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    cd yourrepository
    ```

2. Install Binwalk:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install binwalk
    ```

3. Add your VirusTotal API key:
    Edit the script and replace the placeholder API key with your own.

    ```python
    API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key'
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script with a disk image file as an argument:
    ```sh
    python script.py <image_file>
    ```

    Replace `<image_file>` with the path to your disk image file.


## Example

To run the script on a disk image file named `sample.img`:
```sh
python script.py sample.img
```

This will extract files from `sample.img`, compute their SHA-256 hashes, and print VirusTotal scan results for each file.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run Binwalk with root privileges.
- The script requires an active internet connection to query the VirusTotal API.
